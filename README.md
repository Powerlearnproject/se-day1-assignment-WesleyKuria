#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project goals, scope, and feasibility.
Requirements Analysis – Gather functional and non-functional requirements.
Design – Architect system structure, database, and UI/UX design.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate code.
Testing – Conduct unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
Deployment – Release the software to users.
Maintenance – Address bugs, update features, and optimize performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach with distinct phases.

Works best for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government or banking systems).

Changes are difficult once development starts.

Testing happens at the end, increasing risk of late-stage issues.

Agile is an iterative, flexible approach with continuous development.

Ideal for evolving projects like startups and web applications.

Encourages frequent feedback and adaptation to change.

Testing is integrated throughout, ensuring early issue detection.

Key Difference: Waterfall is structured and rigid, while Agile is adaptive and incremental.
Example Scenarios:
Waterfall: A hospital management system where regulatory compliance requires fixed specifications before development.
Agile: A mobile app startup where user feedback drives continuous improvement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, debugs, and implements features.
Quality Assurance Engineer – Tests software for bugs, ensures performance, and writes automated tests.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, coordinates teams, and manages risks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline coding with tools like auto-completion, debugging, and compilation.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS) manage code changes, track history, and enable collaboration.
Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging Complex Code – Use logging, debugging tools, and systematic troubleshooting.
Technical Debt – Prioritize refactoring and maintain clean code.
Collaboration Issues – Use Agile practices and communication tools like Slack or Jira.
Security Vulnerabilities – Follow best practices in encryption and access control.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., testing a login function).
Integration Testing – Verifies interactions between modules (e.g., checking API calls).
System Testing – Validates the entire system against requirements.
Acceptance Testing – Ensures software meets end-user expectations before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to interact optimally with AI models. It improves response accuracy, efficiency, and relevance in AI-generated outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: “Tell me about climate change.”
Improved Prompt: “Summarize the main causes and effects of climate change in under 100 words.”
Why is the improved prompt better?

It provides clarity (focuses on causes and effects).
It sets constraints (word limit).
It ensures a concise and targeted response.
